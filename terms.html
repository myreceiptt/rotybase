				<br><br>
				<h3>SECTION 6 – CRYPTO ITEMS</h3>
				<br>
				You accept and acknowledge:
				<br><br>
				1. When purchasing one of our <a style="color: yellow;">NFTs</a> from us (means any blockchain-tracked, non-fungible token that we have produced and that we offer through a merchant website), you acquire a non-exclusive, world-wide,  royalty-free, license to use, copy, display the related artwork associated with the <a style="color: yellow;">NFT</a>, for you own personal, non-commercial use. However, you do not own the underlying copyright in the content the <a style="color: yellow;">NFT</a> is associated to, nor any copyright related to the component images and graphics, technology or process used in the making of the artwork or of the <a style="color: yellow;">NFT</a>. Furthermore, you are getting the <a style="color: yellow;">NFT</a> and license “as is”. You can use the artwork when you are on a marketplace that allows the purchase and sales of your token, as long as the marketplace cryptographically verifies that you are the owner. You can also use your artwork to commercialize your own merchandise, provided that you do not earn more than US$100,000 in revenue each year from doing so. However, you cannot modify the artwork, use the artwork to sell or promote third party products, use the artwork in connection with images of hatred, violence or any other inappropriate behaviour. You cannot try to trademark the artwork, or otherwise acquire intellectual property rights in it.
				<br><br>
				2. The License granted in above Section 6-1 only applies to the extent that you continue to own the relevant <a style="color: yellow;">NFT</a>. If at any time you trade, donate, giveaway, transfer or otherwise dispose of your <a style="color: yellow;">NFT</a> for any reason, the license granted in Section 6-1 will immediately expire and without notice, and you will have no further right in or to the artwork of this <a style="color: yellow;">NFT</a>.
				<br><br>
				3. The prices of crypto items are extremely volatile, and the prices of other digital items can adversely affect the prices of the <a style="color: yellow;">NFTs</a>. We cannot guarantee that any purchaser of crypto item will not lose money. In particular, a number of factors may affect the prices of <a style="color: yellow;">NFTs</a>, including (but not limited to), buyers’ interest, market fluctuation, technological changes, regulatory environment.
				<br><br>
				4. We do not represent that our <a style="color: yellow;">NFTs</a> may constitute a valuable purchase, or that their value may increase with time. Please do not buy any of our products with any expectation of profit. When purchasing any of our <a style="color: yellow;">NFTs</a>, you accept and confirm that you have no expectation of profit. The <a style="color: yellow;">NFTs</a> that you buy from us are not investment contracts, and we disclaim any claim associated with any speculation you or other users may engage in connection to these <a style="color: yellow;">NFTs</a>. You are fully aware that the value of the <a style="color: yellow;">NFTs</a> may drop to zero, and that they may become unsellable by lack of demand for them. As a result, you are fully aware that you may lose the entirety of the value spent, as well as gas costs, transfer costs, and other purchasing costs.
				<br><br>
				5. You are solely responsible if any taxes apply to your crypto items and transactions. We are not responsible for determining the taxes that may apply to you.
				<br><br>
				6. We do not store or send your crypto items. Any transfer of crypto items occurs within the supporting blockchain.
				<br><br>
				7. There are risks associated with using an Internet based currency, including but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information sorted within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that <a style="color: yellow;">Prof. NOTA</a> will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delay that you may experience when using our services or products, however caused.
				<br><br>
				8. The regulatory regime governing <a style="color: yellow;">NFTs</a> and crypto currencies is uncertain, and new regulation or policies may adversely affect the services and products that we provide.
				<br><br>
				9. There are risks associated with purchasing user generated content, including but not limited to, the risk of purchasing mislabelled assets, assets that are vulnerable to metadata decay, assets on <a style="color: yellow;">smart contracts</a> with bugs, and assets that may become non-transferable. Assets that your purchase may become inaccessible on our website or merchants’ website. Under no circumstances shall the inability to view your assets serve as ground for a claim against us.
				<br><br>
				10. Please note that we reserve ourselves the right to amend our offers, as described on this website, our <a style="color: yellow;">Discord server</a>, our whitepaper, and/or other places where we advertise our products, including, but limited to, the quantity of products on offer, the roadmap and calendars, and/or prices.
