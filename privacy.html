				<br><br>
				You can review the most current version of this Privacy Policy at any time on this page. We reserve the right to update, change or replace any part of this Privacy Policy by posting updates and/or changes to our website. It is your responsibility to check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of or access to the website following the posting of any changes constitutes acceptance of those changes.
				<br><br>
				<h3>PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
				<br>
				<a style="color: yellow;">Prof. NOTA</a> promotes NFTs, through our website as well as through various third party websites and platforms. We have adopted this Privacy Policy to guide you through the collection, use, retention, and disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information (“Personal Data”, as further described below) that you may provide while using <a style="color: yellow;">The ROTY BROI</a> websites and services in connection with these platforms (collectively referred to as “Services”).
				<br><br>
				<a style="color: yellow;">Prof. NOTA</a> encourages you to read this Privacy Policy, as well as our Terms and Conditions of Use, in order to understand how we collect and process Personal Data in the course of providing the Services and your interaction with the Services.
				<br><br>
				By using the Services, you consent to the collection, use, retention, and disclosure of your Personal Data for processing as described in, and subject to the limitations set out in, this Privacy Statement.
				<br><br>
				Note to Residents of the European Union:
				<br><br>
				In order to comply with the requirements of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for our European users, this Privacy Statement outlines the legal basis on which we process your Personal Data and provides other information required by the GDPR.
				<br><br>
				<h3>PURPOSE</h3>
				<br>
				Protecting your privacy is important to us.
				Personal Data is any information that would identify a person directly, or indirectly in combination with data from other sources. For example, a full name, home or work address, phone number, national identification number (SSN, SIN, etc), email address, banking details, IP address, biometric data, usage data, or any information that may individually identify a person.
				<br><br>
				<a style="color: yellow;">Prof. NOTA</a> may collect Personal Data including without limitation your name, email address, IP address, and device identifiers and/or geolocation information, in the course of its Services, and may use or disclose that Personal Data as described with this Privacy Policy.
				<br><br>
				We may also create de-identified or anonymized data from Personal Data by excluding data components (such as your name, email address, etc.) that makes the data able to personally identify you, through obfuscation, or through other means. In addition, we may collect and use aggregated, anonymous information to provide data about the Services to advertisers, potential business partners, and other unaffiliated entities. As this information does not identify a person and is therefore not Personal Data, <a style="color: yellow;">Prof. NOTA</a> when using such aggregated, anonymized and/or de-identified data is not subject to this Privacy Statement.
				<br><br>
				<h3>SECTION 1 - WHAT DO WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
				<br>
				When you use our website, we may collect the personal information that you voluntarily give us such as your name, and email address.
				We may also automatically receive your computer’s internet protocol (IP) address in order to provide us with information that helps us learn about your browser and operating system. Your consent is implied to collect and use your Personal Data to facilitate that use or complete that transaction initiated by you only. Email marketing (if applicable): if you have joined our mailing list, or if you email us, we may also send you emails about our new products, and other updates. You can opt out of our email list by selecting such a feature on our email.
				<br><br>
				<h3>SECTION 2 – CONSENT</h3>
				<br>
				<b>How do you get my consent?</b>
				<br><br>
				If we ask for your personal information for a reason, like for marketing purposes, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent or provide you with an opportunity to say no.
				<br><br>
				<b>How do I withdraw my consent?</b>
				<br><br>
				If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at any time, by contacting our Privacy Compliance Officer (See contact at the end of this page).
				<br><br>
				<h3>SECTION 3 – DISCLOSURE</h3>
				<br>
				We may disclose your personal information to government authorities if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of Service.
				<br><br>
				<h3>SECTION 4 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICE</h3>
				<br>
				In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.
				<br><br>
				However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.
				<br><br>
				For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.
				<br><br>
				In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.
				<br><br>
				As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.
				<br><br>
				Once you leave our store’s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.
